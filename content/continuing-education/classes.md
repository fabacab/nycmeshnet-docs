We have held a few in-person classes on network concepts for our friends and neighbors who showed interest. If you would like to organize or participate in another of these sessions, please join us in [the `#meetings` channel on our Slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/meetings) to help coordinate more of these. You might be asking yourself, "What do these classes look like?" The following video provides a good example of a typical NYC Mesh networking class and was recorded in December 2018:

This NYC Mesh Networking 101 class was generously taught by Zach Giles. You can [download the slides from Zach's presentation from Google](https://goo.gl/dwXSwo).

## Other community-run in-person classes

We are fortunate to be in New York City, one of the most populous and technically savvy cities in the world. This means there are numerous other organizations that also provide free or extremely low-cost computer networking classes specifically for NYC residents and community members.

### [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/)

The Tech Learning Collective (TLC) is an educational initiative run by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. They regularly host free, by-donation, and low-cost [workshops](https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/) on computer networking topics that provide the foundations necessary to understand any internetworking scenario. View the [TLC event calendar](https://techlearningcollective.com/events/) to find out when they are hosting their next free or by-donation workshop.

This community group is also an [EFF Electronic Frontier Alliance](https://www.eff.org/electronic-frontier-alliance) member and may be of particular interest to women, gender non-conforming/non-binary, and queer people, who may be more likely to find other technology groups less comfortable places to learn.

The Tech Learning Collective also offers a four-week [NET101 Course](https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html) with sliding scale tuition that is available exclusively to community activists and others working on non-commercial projects in their neighborhood. The course covers the majority of the material in NYC Mesh's own "Networking 101" courses (linked above), as well as providing more detail on the topics of Ethernet encapsulation, network security considerations, and SoHo router configuration.
