We have presented a few classes on network concepts and provided free training materials to our friends and neighbors who showed interest. This includes:

* Networking 101 version 1, by Zach Giles, Early 2017 [Slides](https://goo.gl/i9Asx4)
* Networking 101 version 2, by Zach Giles, December 2018 [Slides](https://goo.gl/dwXSwo), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vi-wlEMWOc)

## Other community-run in-person classes

We are fortunate to be in New York City, one of the most populous and technically savvy cities in the world. This means there are numerous other organizations that also provide free or extremely low-cost computer networking classes specifically for NYC residents and community members.

### [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/)

The Tech Learning Collective (TLC) regularly hosts free and by-donation [workshops](https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/) on networking topics that provide the foundations necessary to understand any computer networking scenario, as well as numerous advanced network security classes. View the [TLC event calendar](https://techlearningcollective.com/events/) to find out when they are hosting their next free or by-donation workshop.

This community-run education intiative also runs an extremely low-cost, four-week [NET101 course](https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html) that is available exclusively to community activists and others working on non-commercial projects in their neighborhood.
