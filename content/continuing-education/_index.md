As a community-owned and volunteer-operated network, it is important to NYC Mesh that any community member who wishes to gain the skills necessary to become a competent network technician can do so. As more of our neighbors learn more about how their Internet connections work, the better our network becomes. In this section, we provide links to educational material that we have produced ourselves as well as links to other quality resources that share our focus on affordable and fair internetwork connectivity.
