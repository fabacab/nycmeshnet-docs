title: Recommended Reading
---

While much of the knowledge required to set up, operate, and maintain a community-owned network such as NYC Mesh is certainly a specialized area of expertise, all of this knowledge is attainable through free and open educational resources. That said, there are numerous books and other compendiums that provide a more guided pathway through the sometimes overwhelming amount of material that is available today. In this section, we provide a list of readings that we think are particularly helpful to people who want to set up and operate their own community-owned network.

## Books

Here we list resources that are presented in the format of a book, either a printed and paper-bound volume, or its digital equivalent.

* [Wireless Networking in the Developing World (WNDW)](http://wndw.net/) - Free book about designing, implementing, and maintaining low-cost wireless networks. Considered *essential* reading by many long-time NYC Mesh volunteers.
