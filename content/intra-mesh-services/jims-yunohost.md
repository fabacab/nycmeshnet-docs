title: Jim's YunoHost
---

Someone apparently named Jim runs an instance of the [YunoHost server hosting software](https://yunohost.org/) at the various domains:

* `jimsblog.mesh`
* `jim.mesh`

This server's IP address is `10.70.140.70`, and also apparently hosts an [intra-mesh mail service]({{< relref "mail" >}}) using the same YunoHost software.
