Not much is currently known about this service.

The `ebook.mesh` domain is [registered](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmesh-dns/blob/354e9303285f3e18574239dbad0257a0399db83f/mesh.zone#L13) to IP address `10.70.129.51`, but there is no known service running on this host. Perhaps it was a personal [ebook server or a library system](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#e-books-and-integrated-library-systems-ils) of some sort?
