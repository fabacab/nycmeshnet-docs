title: Taking Panorama Photos
---

Before an NYC Mesh Install Team attempts to install a new node, they need to know whether the new node is located in a position with direct line of sight (LOS) to an existing hub or supernode. This is because, due to [the way radio waves propagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation), the existing and new nodes need to be able to see each other in order to connect to one another. If there are obstacles, such as tall buildings or other structures, in between the existing hub and potential new node, the radio signal transmitted from the existing node will not be able to reach the new node's radio receiver, and vice versa.

To save time and help the Install Team determine whether line of sight is possible, NYC Mesh asks new members who submit a [join request](https://nycmesh.net/join) to provide a panoramic photo from their rooftop or window as part of the informtion they send in when becoming members. An Install Team volunteer may also visit the new node location themselves, especially in the case of do-it-yourself installers, and take a panoramic photo as part of their very first site survey.

This page documents best practices for taking good panoramic photos and explains how to annotate them so that they will be of the most use to the Install Team.

### Where to find the panorama photo function on your phone

Most cell phone cameras have panoramic photo capability in camera mode. 

**iPhone**

On iPhones, this feature will be a scrollable option on the bottom of the camera screen.

### Taking a good panorama image

Taking a panorama image should show as much of the surrounding landscape as possible. We need to see the line of sight to the nearest supernode or hub as well as any buildings surrounding your line of sight. If you cannot see the nearest supernode or hub from your current position, please move so that your panorama will include a visual. If you are willing and able, please feel free to annotate cardinal directions and nearest supernode or hub (see examples below).

### Best practices for roof panoramas

* 360 degrees shown
* identify which side of your building is the closest node
* clear and well-lit (daytime photos only)
* include existing antenna masts

### Best practices for window panoramas

* 180 degrees shown
* open window and put your arm all the way out
* show as much of the view out of the window as possible 
* tilt your phone upwards if necessary to capture the tops of nearby buildings
* clear and well-lit (daytime photos only)
