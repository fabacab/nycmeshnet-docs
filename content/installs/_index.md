In order to connect to NYC Mesh, members typically need to install physical equipment (a router, antenna, cabling, etc.) within radio range of an existing member's installation. We refer to each of these installations as *nodes*. To expand the mesh, new nodes must be installed on building rooftops across the city.

This section documents the process of installing a new node from start to finish in as much detail as possible. It is intended to be a complete reference for NYC Mesh Install Teams and is therefor quite verbose. Unless you are an Install Team leader or volunteer, you may find our much shorter [typical installation overview]({{< relref "overview/install-example" >}}) more appropriate.

In addition to these pages, we sometimes hold [in-person classes]({{< relref "continuing-education/classes" >}}) to help new NYC Mesh community members learn about how NYC Mesh works. Our [Install Training Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y0bafeH7h9SuAOrUSC_WHOnA7q-rLGTD0OOOmZLBETg/edit?usp=sharing) is a slideshow often displayed at these installation trainings; you can refer to it for another up-to-date overview of the entire install process.
