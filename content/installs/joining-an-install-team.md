title: Joining an Install Team
---

If you would like to help NYC Mesh expand our network, one way to do so is to volunteer to join an Install Team. These are self-selecting groups of community members who physically labor to bring new nodes online. Experienced Install Team members may eventually become Install Team leaders if they would like to take on responsibilities that are related to but are above and beyond performing the physical labor of installing hardware at new node locations.

Before you volunteer to join an Install Team, consider reading about what's involved in a [typical install]({{< relref "overview/install-example" >}}) so that you know what you're getting yourself into. Once you're sure that you want to volunteer as an installer, the process for joining an Install Team for the first time is as follows:

1. [Sign up for a free account on our Slack chat](https://join.slack.com/t/nycmesh/shared_invite/enQtNDk0NDA4OTAyNDY0LTU5NWMyODY5ZTYyMDY2NzgzOTJmZjFmZTg3YWRjYjE0M2EyMzlhNDE3YmIxZmZhYTZmNjIwNTVkMDIwMjI2ZDg) if you do not already have one.
1. [Upload your headshot to your Slack profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115005506003-Upload-a-profile-photo) so that fellow Install Team volunteers can recognize you when you arrive on site.
1. Join [the `#install-team` channel](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/install-team) on Slack. This is where logistics regarding installations are coordinated.
1. Wait for an install request to be posted to the channel by our NYCMesh [Slack app](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/360001537467-A-guide-to-apps-and-the-App-Directory). The install request post will include details such as the date and time, location, and additional notes provided by the new node owner, along with contact information for how to reach them. An example (redacted) install request is shown in the screenshot below:
    {{< figure src="/img/screenshot.install-team.slack.install-request.png" alt="" caption="An example install request." >}}
1. If you are available at the time of the requested install and are confident that you can arrive to the install location on time, respond to the install request thread saying so.

By the time you see the posting, others may have already "picked up" the installation, in which case you may be told that no more volunteers are needed and encouraged to volunteer for a different installation instead.

Otherwise, you may be told that you are welcome to join the Install Team for that install operation. In that case, make sure you are prepared by reading the remainder of the [New Node Installation Guide]({{< relref "installs" >}}) of the documentation so that you know what to do when you arrive on site.
