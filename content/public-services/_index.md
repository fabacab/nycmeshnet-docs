In addition to more local, [intra-mesh services]({{< relref "intra-mesh-services" >}}), the NYC Mesh community operates several public services for the benefit of our members and the public at large.

In this documentation, when we say that these services are available to the public, we mean that anyone connected to the Internet can connect to and use them, regardless of whether they are connected to the NYC Mesh network itself. Usually, this is because these services are run on computers that have public IP addresses (such as the [Internet gateways that connect NYC Mesh to the Internet]({{< relref "overview/internet-connectivity" >}})) as opposed to the internal, [private IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address#Private_addresses) used by intra-mesh services, although this is not always the case. In some situations, a service may be publicly accessible even if its hosting computer only has a private IP address, but this requires special routing considerations.

This section documents the public services NYC Mesh operates.
