A [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) server operated by Eric Zhu is available at the DNS name [Excellent.nyc](https://excellent.nyc/). It is a free file host hosted at NYC Mesh's Supernode 3. Anyone can get 10G of free storage. It can support around ~25 users for now. In Eric's words:

> I choose Nextcloud because it is very user friendly, and there is a nice mobile app, and desktop sync app. I have also enabled contacts + calendar sync. I use it myself coz i want to rely on other services less; to be more autonomous :)
