title: File Sharing
---

A [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) server was operational at IP address `199.167.59.80`, but it has since been replaced by a [Pydio](https://pydio.com/) (Community Edition) file sharing server called "al's File Share," so it is presumably run by someone named Al.

It is unclear at the time of this writing whether this service is intentionally public or is simply publicly-routable.
